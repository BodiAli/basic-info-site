    <h2>Here are five facts about computers!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The first modern computer was massive. There are arguments over what the first computer was. Some
        people say it was an abacus which is a counting device that has been used for centuries. However the
        first modern computers were electronic calculating machines and were developed during the Second World
        War. One computer would take up rooms and parts of the computers were put on wheels because they were
        so big.

        The first modern computer was basically a giant calculator. Even though the first modern computer was
        massive it could actually only do 4 things. Add, subtract, multiply and divide. Can you believe that
        now we have calculators on our phones when once upon a time a calculator would take up a room the size
        of a school hall.

        Computers work through special instructions called algorithms. Computers work by following
        instructions. These instructions are called algorithms. Computers don’t have common sense so
        algorithms have to be really clear for them to understand. If there is even a small mistake in an
        algorithm then the computer won’t be able to complete a task. Ada Lovelace invented the first computer
        algorithms

        Phones are computers. We use computers everyday without even knowing it. Lots of things we call by
        other names are types of computers. For example mobile phones, tablets, smart speakers, laptops and
        games consoles are all examples of computers.

        A computers memory is called RAM. RAM stands for Random Access Memory and is its short term memory.
        Without it the computer wouldn’t be able to do anything from opening files to streaming a video.
